So, what's been implemented since last week:
- Magical Hierarchy over structs (All composition, a defined through overloading)
- Composition of deforested functions is implemented

An open questions:

- What should be in magical hierarchy?
	- **Iso**
	- **Lens**
	- **Prism**
	- **Option**
	- **Setter**
  In that scheme there's no need for getter. unless we won't add something
- Should we introduce something of our own in this hierarchy? Maybe like analogue of `Traversable` but with more OO nudge to it
- Different types of optics for the same structure. Now only **__downcast** is supported, but, potentially, we should be able to support `__downcast_prism`,`__downcast__setter`, `...`
- Curried functions as optics. `nth(3)` returning an actual optics. Maybe for convention it will be better
- User defined optics. What even is it? What kind of signature they should contain. User defined open hierarchy? How? Maybe leave some hole for it.
- How about local polymorphic optics? `Setter` allows us to be polymorphic
