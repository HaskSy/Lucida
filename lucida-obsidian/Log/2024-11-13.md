Finally got my hands on writing of brief summary of discussion of 2024-11-11.

After some discussions. It's been decided to reimplement (maybe not entirely, we'll see) an Arrow library. So:

- [ ] #TODO Read up in details how exactly an Arrow library works
- [ ] #TODO Reimplement as library for the language

Also I've collected some questions which nobody knows the answer to yet:

- [ ] #DESIGNQ Interface as return type??? What happens with optics then
- [ ] #DESIGNQ  Is polymorphic optics actually necessary? Try to stick to monomorphic for now
- [ ] #DESIGNQ  Is the goal to make COW for classes?
- [ ] #DESIGNQ  Check the optics properties for `prop` fields?
- [ ] #DESIGNQ  Is the goal to introduce mechanism to work with `mut` outside of structure? This one might be something actually viable to incorporated inside the language

Thus... the copypasta we're doing
