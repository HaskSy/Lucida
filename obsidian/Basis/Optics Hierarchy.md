Here's the hierarchy structure which is identical to the [[Arrow Library]] hierarchy and [[Monocle Library]] too
![[Pic. Optics Hierarchy]]

- [ ] #TODO Is `Optional` the same as `AffineTraversal`? or not?
- [ ] #TODO where does such weird beast as `Grate` located?

The Importance of hierarchy is to specify what type does composition of optics should be. 
- Like if you compose Lenses you still get Lenses 
- or how you compose Lens and Traversal and get Traversal
- Some things are not composable
