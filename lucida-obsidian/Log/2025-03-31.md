Back to my wasteful thinking. Today's subject is: Optics usage scenarios. I want to recollect once again what user can do with optics and finish on syntax. Maybe I will about user-defined optics here as well.

Also, it's important for me to figure out, what kind of optics we're able to derive.

## Struct/Class field Lenses
```
@DeriveOptics
struct/class A {
	public var z: String
	public A(
		public var x: B,
		public let y: String
	) { }
}
```
- **Primary constructor** should exist.
- **Primary constructor** should not contain variables which are not fields
- Optics is generated for `public/(package private) var` both inside `class/struct` body and constructor
- Optics is generated for `public/(package private) let` inside constructor
	- #QUESTION Should it? It might be hell of a lot confusing
- For `public` optics it is exported via `extend` with supplementary interface

> If we want to support `private/protected` fields inside of `struct/class` (By supporting I mean not generation of optics, but having an ability to copy the values of struct, so more combinations are supported)
> 
>  We need to either generate optics inside of a `struct/class`, which is bad, or support `private extend`
## Enum Prisms
```
@DeriveOptics
enum EnumList<T> {
	| Nil
	| Cons(T, EnumList<T>)
}
```
 - This one is simple, but doesn't feel very much useful. Prisms perform matching, and if it succeeds, then return all arguments, otherwise, return old value
## Tuple Lenses

- Here I'll just have to create a bunch of overloadings for different sizes of tuples, because I couldn't create a polymorphic solution using HList
## Array/HashMap/Collection Optional
- #TODO  Can I simply implement `Magical<Collection<T>>` and hope that methods in `Magical<Array<T>>` will be visible?
> Not really, unless **required constructor** will be implemented
- #DESIGNQ Consider marking some methods in the interface as constructor to use them in reconstruction process
- I'd suggest to put the question of interfaces for later, and stick with obvious `Array<T>`, `HashMap<K, V>`.
- Then we can **curry** our optics, or make it **lazy** to evaluate
> I'll stick with curry, for now. But lazy approach feels better, because of resolve argument might be unnecessary most of the time.
- Those will be hand-written at least for now
## Deriving Setters (User-defined setters)

```swift
@OpticsSetter
public func map<T, R>(transform: (T) -> R): (Iterable<T>) -> Iterator<R> { ... }

@OpticsSetter
public func map<T, R>(source: Iterable<T>, transform: (T) -> R): Iterator<R> { ... }

extend <T> Array<T> {
	@OpticsSetter
	public func map<R>(transform: (T) -> R): Array<R> { ... }
}
```

- The idea is that, every example, described above, will be registered as setter in form of:
`(S, (A) -> A) -> S`.
- In future, it might be represented as `(S, (A) -> B) -> T`
- If goes into compiler, neccesity for macro will disappear and everything will be simply checked by it's form
- #DESIGNQ Consider marking some objects as `@Profunctor` or something similar, to allow then also as arrow arguments. Or `extend (A) -> B`
- Function has to be 

## Deriving Iso
```
@DeriveOptics
public struct/class A {
	public A (
		public let x: String
	) { }
}
```
- #DESIGNQ Consider deriving **Iso** for `struct/class` whose primary constructor has only one argument, and has no fields outside of it.
- #DESIGNQ `@Lucida(x&.y.z.convert<String>().convert<Array<Byte>>().at(3))`

## User-defined optics (Common used)

The idea is that commonly used set of composition can be stored in special function.

For example
```swift
@OpticsCompose
public func nth2d<T>(i: UInt64, j: UInt64): Optional<Array<Array<T>, T> {
	nth(i)?.nth(j)
}
```

- I don't really like this option, because it look like a way to avoid current problems with inlining. This can easily be avoided by fixing first classness for structs. (Allow unwrap structs, whose content is statically known)
