I've found some particularly interesting term which awfully close resembles optics. **Bidirectional Models**. Here's some Wikipedia links, related, and then I will be able to figure some citations from that. At least several:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_transformation
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_transformation#Unidirectional_versus_bidirectional
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectionalization

I've found some interesting article, which looks into optics in very practical way:
